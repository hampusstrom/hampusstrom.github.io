# Introduction
Have you already automated all your Microsoft product updating needs with [Automatic Deployment Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/sum/deploy-use/automatically-deploy-software-updates), but you're still manually updating Third-Party updates like Adobe Reader through SCUP/the MEMCM console? 
Ever thought about how nice it would be if you could use for Third-Party products like Adobe Reader? Yeah, me too.  

You might even have tried it and cried a little bit when you noticed that Automatic Deployment Rules don't pick up Third-Party Updates until they have been published. Me too.    

You may have cried even more when you noticed that there is no PowerShell cmdlet that lets you automate the publishing either. Again, me too. 

Until now it has only been possible to fully automate Third-Party update deployments by using third party software solutions like [PatchMyPC](https://patchmypc.com/). However, with ConfigMgr 2103 this has finally changed, thanks to the addition of the following PowerShell cmdlet:   
[Publish-CMThirdPartySoftwareUpdateContent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/configurationmanager/publish-cmthirdpartysoftwareupdatecontent?view=sccm-ps). I could not find anything about this cmdlet in the [ConfigMgr 2103 Patch Notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/changes/whats-new-in-version-2103#powershell), but as you can see it is in the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/configurationmanager/publish-cmthirdpartysoftwareupdatecontent?view=sccm-ps).

Now, with the help of a little bit of scripting we can publish and deploy Third-Party Updates automatically without the need for expensive products, hell yeah!  

Here's how I did it and how you can do it too.

# Prerequisites
